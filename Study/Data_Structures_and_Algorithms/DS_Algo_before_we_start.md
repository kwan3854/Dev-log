# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

### What is data structure?

> "When a program is dealing with the data, how it will organize the data in the main memory, that's what datastructure is. The way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program, that is data structure."

### What are the list of data structures?

- **Physical Data Structure** - define how the data is arranged in the memory
  - Arrays
  - Matrices
  - Linked List

- **Logical Data Structure** - define how the data can be utilized
  - Stack
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graph
  - Hashing

### Why you should learn data structures?

1. It is core subject for programmers/IT professionals.
2. If you working as a programmer in the industry, you have to use data structures in your application development. Without data structures, you cannot develop app at all.

### At what level one should study data structures?

1. Level1: You know what these data structures are and how they work.
2. Level2: You know how they work in detail and you are able to do the analysis (ex: time and space complexities).
3. Level3: You know everything in detail and you also know how to code them. You can develop your own data structures.

### To what level this course covers data structures?

From Level1 to Level3.

### Which programming language is suitable for data structures?

You can select any language you want.

### Do I have to develop these all data structures by my self?

No. Most of the languages have their built in data structures. You should know how they work and where to use them. But this course goes way beyond that one.

### Which language is used in this course?

C and C++.
